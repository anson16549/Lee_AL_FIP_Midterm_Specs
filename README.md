# FIP_Midterm_Specs
This is the folder about my Future Basic Design for FIP, it has few easy JS, Ajax, Sass and css. I tried to make my website as simple as possilbe also looks really clean and fancy and the same time. The JS Function will be inside the Gallery Page. It has three buttons, it will switch and change some different work pictures once you click on them. I had also tried on Ajax with broken code I've tried few different ways but it's still not working. I will figure out at FIP.
